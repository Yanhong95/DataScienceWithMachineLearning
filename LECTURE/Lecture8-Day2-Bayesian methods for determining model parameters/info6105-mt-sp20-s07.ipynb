    "[Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) is the American version of a popular global banking game known as **Twenty-One**, whose relatives include *Pontoon* and *Vingt-et-Un*. It is a comparing card game between one or more players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer. Players do not compete against each other, they compete against the dealer. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and is the *most widely played casino banking game in the world*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Players are each dealt two cards, face up or down depending on the casino and the table. In the U.S., the dealer is also dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). In most other countries, the dealer only receives one card face up. The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one *or* eleven. A hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called \"*soft*\", meaning that the hand will not bust by taking an additional card. The value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer's turn. The dealer hand will not be completed if all players have either busted or received *blackjacks* (=21). The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit (draw another card) until the cards total up to 17 points. At 17 points or higher the dealer *must* stay (at most tables the dealer also hits on a \"*soft*\" 17, i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six). You are betting that you have a better hand than the dealer. The better hand is the hand where the sum of the card values is closer to 21 without exceeding 21. The detailed outcome of the hand follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card (called a \"*blackjack*\" or \"*natural*\"), and the dealer does not, the player wins and usually receives a bonus.\n",
    "- If the player exceeds a sum of 21 (\"*busts*\"); the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.\n",
    "- If the dealer exceeds 21 (\"*busts*\") and the player does not; the player wins.\n",
    "- If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust; the player wins.\n",
    "- If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum, called a \"*push*\", *no one* wins.\n",

    "\n",
    "To answer that question, we formulate two hypotheses: the **null hypothesis H0** is a model of the tosses if the histogram above is due to ***chance***. The **alternate hypothesis HA** is a model of a **crooked** (unfair) coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally we should compute the probability of seeing a this empirical histogram effect $E$ under ***both*** hypotheses; that is $P(E \\;|\\; H0)$ and $P(E \\;|\\; \\text{HA})$.  But formulating $HA$ is not always easy, so in conventional hypothesis testing, we just compute $P(E \\;|\\; H0)$, which is the **p-value**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is ***small***, we conclude that our somewhat skewed histogram is unlikely to have occurred by chance, which suggests that the coin is **crooked**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Build the null hypothesis\n",
    "The first step is to get data from our observations and compute a test statistic. The result is some measure of the size of the effect, or **delta**. For example, if we were comparing the mean of two groups, delta is the **difference in the means**. Since we are comparing actual values with expected values, delta is a **chi-squared** statistic: a measure of the distance between the observed and expected values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Build a model\n",
    "The next step is to build a model from our empirical observations and generate simulated data. Then we'll apply the test statistic to the simulated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: How many times does the test statistic for the simulated data *exceed the delta*?\n",
