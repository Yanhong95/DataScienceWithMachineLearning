My finding for the extra HW:

Using Yang's method, when the sample data that needs to be generated is small, the value of the frequency obtained in this step of A[0][i]/n*N will be very small, and 'for_in range(int(i)):' This step calculates the number of times a random number is generated by the absolute value of the frequency. In this case, forcing int(i) to round the corresponding float type will cause the sample data to gradually unify.
for instance, The samples generated in range(int(0.01)) and range(int(0.09)) tend to be the same, which causes the nine times different probability of 0.01 and 0.09 but the steps of generating random numbers are only one time.
When we need generate small data samples, We can magnify the array of frequencies by the appropriate multiplesÂ¶
